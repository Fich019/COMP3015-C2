# COMP3015
This is the repo readme for coursework 1 of COMP3015 


# Version and operating system
For this project, I used visual studio 2019 version 16.8.3 and windows 10 version 20H2.
  
# How does it work?
  My project is opened by running the .exe named "Project_template.exe" in the release folder found in the x64 folder in the zip files. Once run the program will execute without crashes.

# How does it work and what I started with?
  The code runs through a loop which renders the scene and all of the objects in it. In the process of rendering the scene, it has to apply both the shaders that I have designed as well as the textures designed for the object that is the focus of the scene. The object has a diffuse map as well as a normal map and the shader that I chose as the focus of this project is the blinn-phong shader. The code is commented where nessisary outlining the complex aspects of the project in detail as well as a general commenting for everything so it easy to navigate throughout. The functions are evenly spaced to make sure that that along with the comments, the code is easy to read and understand where aspects of it end and others begin.
